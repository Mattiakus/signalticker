# Signalticker
this is a simple bot that is intended to notify people about the newest protests
you will need to do a bit of configuration in beforehand
this repo requires the following programs installed and configured:
- signal-cli
- toot (A mastodon cli client)

also you need to install a python venv in the python folder where you install the instagrapi library. After that you can put your instagram login credentials in the "Data/Instagram" file

### Features to come:
- I want to re-implement shouts
- easier reposting by having a quick-repost list so you don't have to do the post command
- a special command for sharing a post to a list of groups too
- adding people as admins via signal
